1) how npm works with all these eslint, babel, travis



Refactor previous projects

L01     use object destructuring for getting data from wizzar class, and then template string
        use list destructuring for getting first four wizzards
        use array functions (1 arg, 1 method, 1 return types), but keep in mind behaviour with this and arguments.

L02     use modules instead of IIFEs keep in mind that we can spoil non-primitive values using .sort(), pop, shift, slice. to preven it use list.slice().sort() instead. 

Collect modules using webpack, connect the project to eslint.


L03     USE MVC STRUCTURE. model-view-controller pattern. 
        Find data structures and put them off markup. Kepp model and view seperately.
